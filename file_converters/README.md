## `vcf2bgc.py`: a VCF to `bgc` file format converter utility script

This subfolder bundles the `vcf2bgc.py` Python script from Bradley Martin along with `bgc_tools`, to serve as an additional utility script that may prove useful in preparing input files for `bgc`. This script was taken whole cloth from Bradley Martin's file_converters GitHub repository, which Martin released in 2018 under the [MIT License](https://github.com/btmartin721/file_converters/blob/master/LICENSE).

Info from author ([here](https://github.com/btmartin721/file_converters/blob/master/README.md)):

## `vcf2bgc.py`: a VCF to `bgc` file format converter utility script

### Overview

This subfolder bundles the `vcf2bgc.py` Python script from Bradley Martin along with `bgc_tools`, to serve as an additional utility script that may prove useful in preparing input files for `bgc`. This script was taken from Bradley Martin's file_converters GitHub repository, which Martin released in 2018 under the [MIT License](https://github.com/btmartin721/file_converters/blob/master/LICENSE), and edited by Justin Bagley to remove minor issues identified by checking the scripts with pyflakes, McCabe, and PEP 257 docstring style checker via Codacy. Most issues were [resolved](https://app.codacy.com/gh/justincbagley/bgc_tools/issues/index).

Info from original author ([here](https://github.com/btmartin721/file_converters/blob/master/README.md)):

vcf2bgc - converts ipyrad VCF file to BGC (Bayesian Genomic Cline) genotype uncertainty format. Currently only works with 3 populations. Also writes locinames to $prefix_loci.txt
```
### Installation

# vcf2bgc.py

Script to convert VCF files to BGC (Bayesian Genomic Cline) format, using the genotype uncertainties.
Uses the read depth for each allele and each individual
which is output in the ipyrad VCF file.

BGC format looks like this:

Parental population files:
locus_1
22 4
1 21
4 55
33 0
locus_2
33 5
22 3
0 1
0 0

Admixed population files:
locus_1
pop_0
0 0
0 43
33 5
0 33
locus_2
pop_0
22 3
33 5
33 0
0 0

So: the loci contain 4 individuals, and each column represents the read depth
for each allele. Must be bi-allelic data. The admixed file requires a population ID line.
The ipyrad VCF output file contains a column that includes:
GT (Genotype):DP (total reads):CATG (# reads per allele) delimited by a colon.

Dependencies:
	PyVCF (I used version 0.6.8)

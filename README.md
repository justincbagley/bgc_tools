[![Codacy Badge](https://app.codacy.com/project/badge/Grade/5ef81c74f3a34e3ba549e1578ab86721)](https://www.codacy.com/gh/justincbagley/bgc_tools/dashboard?utm_source=github.com&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_content=justincbagley/bgc_tools&amp;utm_campaign=Badge_Grade) [![License](https://img.shields.io/badge/License-BSD%203--Clause-blue.svg)](https://opensource.org/licenses/BSD-3-Clause)

This is the initial development release of `bgc_tools`, a set of utilities for automating `bgc` (Bayesian genomic cline) file prep, analysis, and results plotting, written and developed by Justin Bagley. This software package aids analyses of hybridization using the `bgc` program (Gompert and Buerkle 2012), which uses MCMC to estimate parameters of the Bayesian genomic cline model from genomic SNP/genotype data. This package is under active development but the release is stable.
